Initial set up:

1. Open AWS console and launch the cloudshell. 
2. Follow the instructions below to install terraform in the cloudshell:

	- Install yum-config-manager to manage your repositories.

 	$ sudo yum install -y yum-utils
	
	- Use yum-config-manager to add the official HashiCorp Linux repository.

 	$ sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
	
	- Install Terraform from the new repository.

 	$ sudo yum -y install terraform


3. Clone the git repository to the cloudshell and 'cd' into the cloned repository that contains the code.

4. Type in the following commands respecively:

	$ terraform init
	$ terraform plan
	$ terraform apply
- type in 'yes' when prompted.

5. The above command will spawn all the required resources and after 3-5 minutes your instances & web
 servers will be up and running.

6. If you want to ssh into the instances use the pem key attached to the zip file. You wil need a linux based environment to do so.
7. To check whether the web servers are running, copy the public ip address and add a prefix: 
	http://your-ip (- for port 80)
	http://your-ip:8081 (- for port 8081)
	http://your-ip:8080 (- for port 8080)
You will see a NGINX default page being displayed. This proved the task was successfull.

If you no longer need the instances due to cost or any other hindrances just use the command below in 
the cloud shell to delete the instances and all its related resources at one go.

	$ terraform destroy
